# Notes app

## Intended for use with Dungeons and Dragons

The intention in the creation of this app is similar to world anvil except from a players perspective. It would allow users to create notes about people, places, things, events. For instance, if you are running a mystery campaign and you needed detailed notes about an NPC over multiple sessions, you could add and update notes and key facts about that NPC.

As of the initial push, the boilerplate back-end code has been set up as has a test, but local testing is giving an error :

```err
error: role "Jason" does not exist
```

If you would like to test, you will need to set up a .env file with

```md
DATABASE_URL=postgres://<user>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<table>
```

If you still see the error (or any other errors), please feel free to contact me
